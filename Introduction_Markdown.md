## The Problem
Green house gases are a problem in our ecosystem that allows more energy to come into our system, but not leave at the same rate, hence the problem being a buildup of the greenhouse gases trapping energy.

## Questions
Curious about when did the accumulation of greenhouse gases appear in our ecosystem and how would we get rid of them? 
- When did the greenhouse gases appear in our ecosystem?
- What country has the highest amount of greenhouse gases?
- How would we get rid of the greenhouse gases?

## Our Data
We used data from (https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv), which allows us to see data from a variety of countries dating back from 1750 - the present. 

## What I Found
Strangely enough the data for methane and nitrous oxide gases only start at 1990, whereas the co2 data starts much earlier than the other two, creating something like an outlier. Sadly I don't know what to do about the rising amount of greenhouse gas based on the data, but overall I do see a trend of how all the gases are only increasing as time goes on. I would say the only way to bring these numbers down is to watch your carbon footprint to prevent the number from increasing at staggering rates once again.
